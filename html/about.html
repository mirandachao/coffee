		<p id="title">WHAT IS COFFEE BREAK STORIES?</p>
		<p>Coffee Break Stories is an online literary journal dedicated to short prose. Readers tell us how much time they have - 5, 10, or 20 minutes - and we give them something to read. They can also customize their experience, choosing to avoid content flagged with sensitive topics and telling us which genres and topics they most want to explore.</p>

		<p>Coffee Break Stories was founded in 2016 by Pia Struzzieri, Conor O'Byrne, Lindsey Baab, and Miranda Chao, four students at Brown University. We launched on January 13, 2017 and have since continued to expand our database.</p>

		<p id="title">THE SUBMISSION PROCESS</p>

		<p>Submissions are read blindly by our editorial board and accepted submissions are uploaded weekly. We have a rolling submission deadline and are always looking for new content in any of our three categories. Submit to our journal <a href="submit.html" class="link">here</a>!</p>

		<p id="title">FAQ</p>

		<p>HOW CAN I GET IN TOUCH WITH MY FAVORITE AUTHOR?</p>
		<p>Sometimes, authors include their contact information in their bio. (Usually this is their personal website or Twitter account.) If they haven't done this, they might not want you to reach out to them directly. If you send us an email, we'd gladly reach out to them for you and see if they'd like to connect.</p>

		<p>HOW DO I ASK FOR A CONTENT FILTER THAT ISN'T ON THE SITE ALREADY?</p>
		<p>Send us an email and we'll include your requested content warning in our "customize" page.</p>

		<p><i> Currently, Coffee Break Stories is brand new! If you have any other questions, please <a href="contact.html" class="link">reach out</a> to us directly! We are always glad to hear from our readers about their experience.</i></p>
