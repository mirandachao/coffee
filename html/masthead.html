			<p><i>A good story has an understanding of the reader, a real love of something, and a strong foundation of strangeness.</i></p>

			<p><i>novel use of adjectives ; specific details that make larger things dissolve ; plots that pay attention to their shapes ; sentences that induce that specific feeling in between my lungs and my stomach (you know!)</i></p>

			<p><i>In my mind successful stories are those that show me a lot, visually and emotionally, without saying much explicitly. A combination of Hemingway (without the toxic masculinity) and Faulkner’s descriptive powers. I like to be tricked into a burst of feeling, to be lured into a single moment that by way of its unexpected beauty and vividness overwhelm the entire story. Flash fiction and poetry work particularly well for me in this way. Original and interesting stories are, of course, a wonderful thing––but I enjoy perhaps more those that tell me an old story in a particular or weird way (as most stories, I think, unconsciously end up doing anyway). That combine a certain string of ideas, images, thoughts, what have you, in such a way as to unlock a flood of feeling.</i></p>

			<p><i>Pizazz, flair, a sense of mystery, something that electrifies my soul, something that need not make me think but makes me feel - a slice of true experience, the human condition. I love a story that both shatters and rebuilds me, leaving me with a deeper awareness of the absurd, of life, of death, and our place within the timeless structure of the world.</i></p>

			<p><i>I have a particular proclivity towards the absurd. If you can make me sad and happy at the same time then you've really done it.</i></p>
