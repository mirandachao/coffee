		<p id="title">SUBMIT TO COFFEE BREAK STORIES</p>

		<p>Coffee Break Stories publishes short prose that entertains, surprises, and makes use of its form in original ways. We are looking for stories that <i>do</i> something in the short space they have - stories that make us feel, think, laugh or cry. We are open to both experimental and traditional forms of prose. Currently, Coffee Break Stories only publishes prose written in English.</p>
